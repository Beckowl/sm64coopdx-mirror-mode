-- name: \\#\\ Mirror Mode v1.3
-- description: Mirror Mode\n\nA romhack compatible mod that flips the entire game world horizontally, so left becomes right and right becomes left.\n\nCamera controls are not flipped (unless you're using the vanilla camera), so you may want to toggle "Flip X axis" in your camera settings.
